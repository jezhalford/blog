Working in a software team can often a bit like running several 100 metre races back-to-back. Whether you use scrum-style sprints or not, chances are you’re often chasing a deadline. So what happens…

Whether you use scrum-style sprints or not, chances are you’re often chasing a deadline. So what happens when all this catches up with us?</p><p name="93a0" id="93a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software is a unique engineering discipline. In software we can produce incredible results very quickly, if we need to. Businesses love this, of course. They like to innovate, to be first to market. Some even like to move fast and break things. </p><p name="4fee" id="4fee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But as any software developer will tell you, this kind of approach is not for the long-term. Technical debt — the horrors that arise from hastily-written code — will eventually catch up with you.</p><p name="a7c0" id="a7c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Imagine you’re building a bridge. You need a bridge, and you need it yesterday. You don’t care how it gets done, you just need to cross that river.</p><p name="d723" id="d723" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So your ever-innovative team, knowing they’re short on time, fire a few ropes across the river, sling up a sort of pulley system and bingo! You’ve got a bridge.</p><p name="7298" id="7298" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For the next six months every single thing that crosses the river needs to be slung on cables and winched over. It’s a real pain at rush hour!</p><p name="b7e7" id="b7e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fortunately, one day someone finds some spare time, and fires a second set of ropes across the river. Now our bridge has twice the capacity! Perhaps we can even do this a few more times, when we get a few minutes here and there. Before long we have the equivalent of an eight lane motorway made out of rope and pulleys. Perfect!</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="bbd9" id="bbd9" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*oaR15dvWwvdem6YZ.jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="681" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0*oaR15dvWwvdem6YZ.jpg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">A rope does not a bridge make</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fb1b" id="fb1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Soon it becomes too difficult and expensive to weave another set of ropes into the available space. We can’t increase our bridge capacity any more. We are technically bankrupt, so it’s time to refactor. </p><p name="9ba9" id="9ba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This time, though, we want to do it properly. We take a few months over it, we build a really nice bridge, and the developers are happy. The rest of the business, though, is fuming. This was an unexpected delay! Why couldn’t those lazy developers build it right the first time?</p></div></div></section><section name="5c85" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f7e2" id="f7e2" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The key to avoiding such unexpected bumps in the road is finding a sustainable pace. Rather than chase ever-shorter deadlines, it’s important to allow a software team to run at a pace they can maintain. This doesn’t mean that pace shouldn’t increase over time — it certainly should. It just means that the whole organisation has to have a understanding of realistic timelines.</p><p name="705e" id="705e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Basecamp, who develop lots of very popular project management software, have a solution to this involving six week cycles:</p><blockquote name="cd72" id="cd72" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Once a six week cycle is over, we take one or two weeks off of <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">scheduled projects</em> so everyone can roam independently, fix stuff up, pick up some pet projects we’ve wanted to do, and generally wind down prior to starting the next six week cycle. Ample time for context switching. <br><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae" data-href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-we-set-up-our-work-cbce3d3d9cae</a></blockquote><p name="ae1f" id="ae1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Sacled Agile Framework (or SAFe), darling of the agile enterprise, also has words to say about giving the team breathing space:</p><blockquote name="e3c6" id="e3c6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Of course, a focus on one thing, delivery, can lead to a lack of focus on another, in this case innovation. Given this constant urgency, there is a risk that if time is not put aside for innovation, the “tyranny of the urgent iteration” will trump the need to constantly innovate. To address this, SAFe provides for <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Innovation and Planning Iterations</em>.<br><a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/innovation-and-planning-iteration/" data-href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/innovation-and-planning-iteration/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">http://www.scaledagileframework.com/innovation-and-planning-iteration/</a></blockquote><p name="9a92" id="9a92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Finally, here’s a StackOverflow question (closed as off-topic, but relevant to us) asking about sprint burnout:</p><blockquote name="182e" id="182e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">…we are now entering in our 18th Sprint release cycle and I’m starting to feel a little burnt out. It isn’t that I don’t like job or my co-workers, it is just that these sprints are… well, <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">sprints</em>. From start to finish I literally feel like I’m racing against the clock to maintain our development velocity. When we are done with the sprint we spend one day planning the next sprint’s feature set and estimates and then off we go again…<br><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1047112/can-burnout-happen-when-doing-scrum-sprints-continuously" data-href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1047112/can-burnout-happen-when-doing-scrum-sprints-continuously" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1047112/can-burnout-happen-when-doing-scrum-sprints-continuously</a></blockquote><p name="6854" id="6854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">So how do we find and set this pace? We use science!</p><figure name="ddd4" id="ddd4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 512px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 73.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*6DFBF969h9F6KXp4.jpg" data-width="960" data-height="702" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6DFBF969h9F6KXp4.jpg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Stand back! I’m going to try science.</figcaption></figure><p name="2da8" id="2da8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The key to gaining a sustainable pace is first understanding our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">current</em> pace. That means looking at historical data and crunching some numbers.</p><p name="f185" id="f185" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Look at the features your team has delivered over the last six months and work out the time taken to deliver each one. That’s the amount of time it took from the point the team started work to the point the feature was delivered to production. Your issue-tracking software (JIRA, Trello etc) should be able to produce a report that contains this data. Once we have that, we can calculate the time difference between those two dates, and calculate the 85th percentile of those values (Excel has a formula for this). Your 85th percentile is the amount of time it took to deliver 85% of the features in your list. Some will have been delivered very quickly — less than a day. Others will probably have taken several months. The 85th percentile figure is a useful value to rule out strange outliers, but still give us some good statistical confidence in what we have left.</p><p name="dd75" id="dd75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did this calculation with some real data from one of my clients and came up with a figure of 60 days. That means that I can say with reasonable confidence, based on historical data, that my client has an 85% chance of delivering any given feature with 60 days. </p><p name="fa8b" id="fa8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">60 days might seem like a long time to you, or it might seem very fast. This figure will vary wildly from team-to-team, so don’t be alarmed if yours if nowhere near mine. </p><p name="2f42" id="2f42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, I calculated the 85th percentile for each individual month. These are the results — </p><pre name="b9e3" id="b9e3" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">Month  | 85th %ile<br>------------------<br>Jan    | 70.9<br>Feb    | 82.5<br>Mar    | 56<br>Apr    | 55<br>May    | 50<br>Jun    | 59<br>------------------<br>ALL    | 60</pre><p name="63e3" id="63e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">As you can see, in January we delivered 85% of features within 70.9 days, but by May we’d got that down to just 50, and in June it went up again to 59.</p><p name="263a" id="263a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, what’s been happening? January’s figures are probably distorted by the Christmas period, and this could well have a knock-on effect into February. Perhaps the increase between May and June is due to some unexpected problem arising from technical debt? Perhaps it’s just because people went on holiday.</p><p name="6751" id="6751" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Taken in isolation these figures won’t mean much, but they’re a useful tool to compare against your teams anecdotal experiences. Perhaps they can explain the fluctuations? I should stress, however, that using such statistics as a motivating factor — or a stick to beat the team with — will rarely yield useful results. Software developers are intelligent people, and it won’t take them long to realise that simply breaking every feature down into two or three smaller ones will dramatically reduce these figures at a stroke.</p><p name="f82d" id="f82d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As well as speaking to members of the development team, you should also speak to people from your wider organisation. Who’s driving the demand for these features? How happy are they with your current pace? What do they feel is an agreeable lead time? Perhaps the real figures you have will help them to understand what’s achievable. </p><p name="1514" id="1514" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Hopefully, by doing this you can arrive at a consensus between your developers and your other stakeholders. Make a simple statement like “We will aim to deliver any new feature within 50 days of starting”. This is just an example, your statement may vary.</p></div></div></section><section name="0562" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="439e" id="439e" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Now that you have a figure to work to, you can start to bring in some more focus to your development work and your wider planning efforts.</p><p name="7f56" id="7f56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you think you should have a reasonable chance of delivering a feature within 50 days, then maybe it makes sense to slice your time up into 50 day cycles, during which your team focuses on just one feature, or two, or however many you think can sustainably work on at once. Your team and the wider organisation will again need to arrive at a consensus here, but the chances are any business will prefer certainty — if you can meet these targets regularly then people will stop feeling the need to push for urgency. They will get used to regular deliveries.</p><p name="e4ca" id="e4ca" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="691b" id="691b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="a037" id="a037" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>

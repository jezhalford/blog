Hello !

## Charters

This week, I’ve been working with a few teams to try to improve their love of the products they develop. I think anyone who manages a team of developers would like to think that their workers were all furiously dedicated souls who have the company’s mission statement written through them like a stick of rock, but that’s probably a long way from reality.

So what happens when a team _doesn’t_ buy in to the product? Perhaps they care a little bit less about doing a great job. Perhaps those niggling bug fixes and tweaks go unfixed. Perhaps they stop looking for things to do and just sit and wait to be given instructions.

It doesn’t sound like a great picture. But the best defence against team apathy is _empowerment_. Teams need to feel like they’re trusted to get on with the job, and be allowed to decide within themselves how best to do that.

So, I’ve been working with a few teams to develop a _Team Charter._ It’s a document that sets out how the team would like to work, that’s agreed with their managers. The idea is that the charter is a declaration of trust. The team says “We’ll do it this way” and the manager says “That’s great, I trust you.”

So what goes into a charter? Well, everyone enjoys a hilarious team name, so that’s a good start. Beyond that it depends on your situation. Do you want the team to define their agile methodology? Key roles and responsibilities? How will they branch and merge? It might also be a good idea to ask the team what their _technical_ product aims are — can they improve monitoring or deployments, do they want to refactor that awful bit that breaks all the time?

Getting your team to define all this and unite behind it is a great step towards demonstrating trust and empowerment, and starts to create an environment in which a team can really thrive.

## Johnny Mnemonic

Dodgy Keanu Reeves films aside, I’ve long been a fan of mnemonics. A mnemonic is just a word that helps you remember something. For example, pretty much the only thing I can still remember from my A-level in Physics is “SUVAT” — displacement (s), initial velocity (u), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), and time (t).It’s a word for remembering the components of the equations of motion, and was pretty useful at the time.

I like to use mnemonics to aid communication of ideas between team members. I’m always saying that communication is key part of software development, because shared understanding helps us to avoid delays. Recently I coined the happy little mnemonic of “BITMAP”, which stands for -


> **B**uild plan  
> **I**nfrastructure  
> **T**est plan  
> **M**issing information, requirements or data  
> **A**rchitecture  
> **P**roductionising…and is hopefully a useful checklist of things to consider before embarking on a new piece of development work.

So, perhaps a mnemonic or two can help your team to build their shared understanding.

## Follow The Leader

Finally I want to mention that “The Lead Developer”, a conference that I’m really sad I missed out on going to, is making me feel better by tweeting out a big collection of videos of their talks. You can find them all at [twitter.com/theleaddev](https://twitter.com/theleaddev) and I suggest you give a few a watch — it’s all good stuff.

Unfortunately (for me at least) the next Lead Dev conference will be in Austin, Texas, and I probably can’t justify the trip out there. Hopefully they’ll be back in the UK soon.

That’s all for this week! There’s always my [blog](https://medium.com/@jezhalford) if you still need something to read.

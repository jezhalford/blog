## Contributing

If you want to correct my spelling or whatever, pull requests are always welcome.

## Credits

This is all based on the excellent [Jekyll Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/jekyll-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowicz.

## Local Development

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server --watch
```
Jekyll will watch your project folder for changes.

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site.
